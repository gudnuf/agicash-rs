## Overview

**Agicash** is a self-custody Bitcoin wallet for Cashu ecash and Lightning payments. Users can send/receive money privately without trusting servers with their keys.

**Core concepts:**
- **Cashu**: Ecash protocol using blind signatures. Mints sign tokens without seeing their content (privacy). Users hold cryptographic proofs that can be transferred peer-to-peer or redeemed.
- **Spark**: Lightning Network SDK for Bitcoin payments
- **Accounts**: Users have Cashu accounts (connected to mints) and Spark accounts (Lightning wallets)

## Working Approach

**Spec-based**: Ask about unclear requirements - don't assume.

**Self-review**: Check your changes for correctness and edge cases before reporting.

**Summarize**: Report files changed, key decisions, and how it works.

**Verify before using**: Before using any function or module — internal or third-party — read its source or type definitions to understand its signature, behavior, and return type. Don't assume based on the name. For third-party packages, check `node_modules/` type declarations. For internal code, read the source file. Never guess at APIs.

**Verify by running**: When unsure how something works — a library API, a runtime behavior, or an edge case — don't guess or hallucinate. Instead, verify by running code: write a small test script and execute it with `bun`, write a quick unit test, or use the Chrome DevTools MCP to test behavior in the browser. Prefer evidence over assumptions.

**Bug fixing**: Reproduce first, then fix. Write a failing test (or use Chrome DevTools MCP to reproduce in the browser), apply the fix, then verify the test passes. When the test has lasting value as a regression test, ask the user if they want to keep it.

## Autonomy

**Ask first:** Installing dependencies, running migrations, destructive operations.

**Do autonomously:** Read/edit code, run tests, use browser tools, run `bun run fix:all`, start dev server.

**Package manager:** Always use `bun` and `bunx`. Never use `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`.

**Git branch:** The default branch is `master` (not `main`). Always use `master` when referencing the base branch for PRs, diffs, rebases, etc.

**After editing TypeScript**: Run `bun run fix:all` to catch type errors before considering the task complete. Don't wait for the user to discover build failures.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | React Router v7 (framework mode) |
| Server State | TanStack Query v5 |
| Client State | Zustand |
| Auth | Open Secret → Supabase RLS |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui |
| Crypto | @cashu/cashu-ts, @buildonspark/spark-sdk, @noble/* |
| DB | Supabase (PostgreSQL) |

## File Structure

See `docs/guidelines.md` for detailed directory structure and import hierarchy rules.

```
app/
├── routes/           # Filesystem routes (_auth, _protected, _public layouts)
├── features/         # Vertical slices (send/, receive/, accounts/, etc.)
├── components/ui/    # shadcn base components
├── lib/              # Utilities (money/, cashu/, spark/, bolt11/)
└── hooks/            # Shared React hooks
```

**Import hierarchy** (never reverse): `lib/components` → `features` → `routes`

## Key Patterns

### Data Fetching (TanStack Query)
```
feature/
├── *-hooks.ts       # Query hooks (useQuery, useMutation)
├── *-repository.ts  # Database access
└── *-service.ts     # Business logic
```
- Never use `useEffect` for data fetching
- Use `queryOptions()` for reusable configs
- Suspense boundaries for loading states

### Money Handling (CRITICAL)
Always use `Money` class (`~/lib/money`) — never raw arithmetic. Floating point errors will cause real financial bugs.

### Authentication & Encryption

**Open Secret** handles auth (email, Google, guest) and stores the user's BIP39 seed. From this seed, the app derives separate keys for Cashu wallets, Spark wallets, and encryption—all client-side.

**Key constraint:** Private keys never leave the browser. Sensitive data (proofs, transaction details) is encrypted client-side before storage. Server cannot decrypt user data.

**Auth flow:** Open Secret JWT → `generateThirdPartyToken()` → Supabase session → RLS enforcement

**Route layouts:** `_protected.tsx` (requires auth), `_auth.tsx` (login/signup), `_public.tsx` (no auth)

### State Management

| State Type | Use | Example |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| **Multi-step flow** | Zustand store | SendStore, ReceiveStore (persists across pages) |
| **Server data** | TanStack Query | Accounts, User, Transactions (caching, refetch) |
| **Transient UI** | useState | Modal open, animation state |
| **Cache control** | Custom Cache class | CashuSendQuoteCache (version-based updates) |

**Rules:** Context is for dependency injection only, not state. Zustand stores accept dependencies via factory function (`createSendStore(deps)`). Use `useSuspenseQuery` for required data (lets Suspense handle loading).

### Error Handling

**Error classes** (`app/features/shared/error.ts`): `DomainError` (user-friendly, never retry), `ConcurrencyError` (always retry), `NotFoundError`.

**Toasts** (Radix UI): One at a time, 3s. `DomainError` → show `error.message`. Unknown errors → `variant: 'destructive'` with generic message + `console.error`. Background tasks → log only, no toasts.

**Retry** (TanStack Query): Queries default 3 retries, mutations 0. `DomainError` → never retry. `ConcurrencyError` → always retry.

## Code Standards

- **Files**: kebab-case (`send-quote-hooks.ts`)
- **Types**: Prefer `type` over `interface`
- **Components**: UI only; logic in hooks
- **Validation**: Zod for all inputs
- **Server code**: `*.server.ts` files only

**Avoid:**
- Derived state in useState (calculate instead)
- Props drilling (use context or TanStack Query)
- Components >200 lines (split them)
- Redundant nullish coalescing (`value ?? null` when value is already `T | null`)
- Returning `null` from functions when `undefined` is more idiomatic (avoids `?? undefined` conversions)
- Excessive code duplication - extract common fields into shared objects. Some duplication is OK if it reduces complexity, but large repeated blocks should be refactored
- Over-abstracting simple code into separate files (e.g., inline simple middleware in route files)
- Adding boilerplate that parent components already handle (e.g., child routes don't need `clientLoader.hydrate` if parent layout has it)

## Comments and JSDoc

Default to no comments. The bar for adding one: a future reader couldn't recover the information from the code itself — a protocol quirk, a library bug being worked around, a perf tradeoff with bounds, a named external constraint (e.g. a specific DB unique constraint). Link the spec/issue/PR when relevant. Verify the reason before writing it; never guess.

Don't write comments that explain things the code or its surroundings already show:
- **Where** something is used or called from ("used by X", "comes from Y") — IDE references handle this
- **Why** a refactor happened or what task it was for ("we changed this to…", "added for X") — that belongs in the commit message, not the code
- **What** the code does step by step — let well-named identifiers carry the meaning

JSDoc goes on public surfaces: exported `lib/` utilities, methods on services and repositories, exported types and their option fields. Skip it on React components, routes, trivial getters, and private helpers. Use `@param` / `@returns` / `@throws` only when they document a real contract.

## Commands

```bash
bun run dev          # Dev server (http://127.0.0.1:3000)
bun run dev --https  # Dev server with HTTPS (https://localhost:3000)
bun run fix:all      # Lint + format + typecheck
bun test             # Unit tests (ask first)
bun run test:e2e     # E2E tests (ask first)
```

## Rust build cache

The devshell wires `sccache` as `RUSTC_WRAPPER` (with `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`,
required for sccache to see rustc invocations). Cache lives at `.sccache/`
in the workspace, gitignored. Wrap cargo commands in `devenv shell -c '...'`
or rely on `direnv` auto-activation to get the 10–30× warm rebuild speedup.
Without the devshell, cargo runs without `RUSTC_WRAPPER` and pays full cold
compile cost. See `crates/README.md` for details.

**Database**: `bun run db:generate-types` after schema changes — but this only works if the migration has been applied first. If you created a new migration file, ask the user to apply it (via Supabase dashboard or `bun supabase migration up`) before running type generation. Do NOT run `db:generate-types` against unapplied migrations — it will silently produce stale types and cause confusing errors downstream.

## Naming Conventions

Hooks: `use{Action}{Entity}`. Query options: `{entity}QueryOptions`. Cache classes: `{Entity}Cache` with static `Key`. Stores: `{feature}-store.ts`.

## Database & Supabase

**Schema:** App data lives in the `wallet` schema (not `public`). Users are in `wallet.users` (not `auth.users`). Always query `wallet.*` tables when working with app data.

Detailed guidelines are available as skills (Claude loads them automatically when relevant):
- `supabase-database` - Migrations, RLS policies, functions, SQL style guide
- `supabase-edge-functions` - Edge function patterns (Deno/TypeScript)

**Key rules:**
- Always enable RLS on new tables
- Separate policies per operation (select/insert/update/delete) and role (anon/authenticated)
- Migration files: `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql`
- Write SQL in lowercase

**Ask first:**
- Applying local migrations (`supabase migration up`)

**Never do:**
- `supabase db reset` - destroys local database data
- `supabase db push` or any remote database operations
- Drop tables/columns without explicit approval
