//! FFI surface for the receive flow orchestrator.
//!
//! Exposes [`ReceiveFlow`] as a long-lived `uniffi::Object` the UI holds onto
//! for the duration of one receive interaction. Methods:
//!
//! - [`ReceiveFlow::current_state`] — snapshot the current state.
//! - [`ReceiveFlow::dispatch`] — feed a UI event in, get the next stable
//!   state back.
//!
//! Mirrors `app/features/receive/receive-cashu-token.tsx`'s React flow but
//! in a UI-agnostic shape — iOS/Android/WASM can each render the same
//! [`ReceiveFlowStateFfi`] without re-implementing the orchestration.
